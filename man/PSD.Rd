\details{
This method calculates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of electrophysiological data
using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and subsequent power calculations.
The data is first bandpass filtered to retain only frequencies of interest.
Then, a FFT is applied to the filtered data to transform it into the frequency domain.
The PSD is computed from the squared magnitude of the FFT results.

The power spectral density is computed using the formula:
\deqn{PSD(f) = 2 \times \frac{1}{T \times N} \times |X(f)|^2}
where |X(f)|^2 is the squared magnitude of the FFT, \eqn{T} is the sampling period,
and \eqn{N} is the number of points in the FFT.
The factor of 2 accounts for the loss of power in the negative frequency components
which are not included in the single-sided PSD.
